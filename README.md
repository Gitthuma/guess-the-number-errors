Guess The Number Errors

To get started, let's return to our number guessing game — except this time we'll be exploring a version that has some deliberate errors introduced. Go to Github and make yourself a local copy of number-game-errors.html (see it running live here).

1. To get started, open the local copy inside your favorite text editor, and your browser.
2. Try playing the game — you'll notice that when you press the "Submit guess" button, it doesn't work!

At this point, let's consult the developer console to see if it reports any syntax errors, then try to fix them. You'll learn how below.
